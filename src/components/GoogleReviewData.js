    text: `Dr. Eugene Rubtsov treated me in 2011-2012 at the practice where he previously worked for 6 yrs. I was no spring chicken, had never broken a bone in my life, and now had a broken collar bone from a motorcycle accident.  I was devastated by how quickly I lost all range of motion on that side. After only a few visits with the therapist initially assigned to me, she went on vacation & Eugene was assigned to me. The difference in my treatment that day was phenomenal. Having no basis for comparison initially, I had no idea what range of motion I could hope to regain, & was not encouraged after the first few visits. As soon as I met Eugene, he asked what result I wanted, & I said I wanted to regain all that I lost since the accident—not really thinking it was possible. That’s exactly what he gave me!  He was as aggressive as I wanted him to be. Had I asked him to go easy with me so it wouldn’t hurt, he’d have done that, & it would have taken much longer, for a lesser result most likely.. That’s not what I wanted, & each time I left there I felt improvement. 

    In Dec 2016 I injured my sacroiliac joint in an injury not nearly as exciting as the first, & knew Eugene had started his own practice a yr & a half earlier. I knew if I was going to progress from excruciating pain & barely able to move, to how I was prior to the injury, I wanted Eugene to treat me.  Once again, he has not disappointed!
    
    Unlike in a large practice, Eugene is able to spend the time he feels he should to give the patient the desired results. When you’re there, you have his full attention. His personality, good nature, & humor are an added bonus!  He’s a good man who loves what he does, and has one primary goal—to help people.
    
    I guarantee you’ll not be disappointed with the care you receive from Dr. Eugene Rubtsov. Pillar Physical Therapy is a most welcome change from the large practices where you’re herded through with 20 other patients, in a prescribed amount of time.  I highly recommend it, as I already have with all my baby boomer friends!`,

      "I had major, major rotator cuff surgery in addition to bicep tenodesis. I could not imagine making a comeback to the worlds of kayaking and backpacking that I enjoy. Under Eugene's expert care, I regained 100% mobility, flexibility, and full arm and shoulder extension and rotation--as if I had never had the problems to begin with. I was truly amazed at the results! Eugene's specialized knowledge and a tailored program that gradually increased in intensity, along with his really great sense of humor, made each physical therapy session enjoyable and rewarding. Hands down, Eugene is the best physical therapist I ever had.",
